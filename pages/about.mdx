  My first programming introduction was during a Data Analytics lecture in grad school. As the professor briefly
  discussed the python programming language and the benefits of using a programming language to solve a problem
  real-world problem, I did a quick google search. I was hooked.

  Computers don't care how old you are, how smart you are, your skin color, socioeconomic background, gender, or if you
  went to college or not. The only requirement is to communicate with the computer using a language that it understands.
  For me, that language is usually Javascript. More specifically, I am passionate about building web applications with
  React and Next.js.

  I hope my articles inspire you to share your knowledge and experiences. There is always someone banging their head
  against the wall to solve a problem you solved yesterday. I would not be writing this blog if it were not for the vast
  amount of free content online that I used to learn how to code. I am happy to finally contribute to the community with
  my lessons learned.

  As for non-tech talk, I live in Columbus, Ohio, with my beautiful wife and two children. I work as a Project Manager
  at a healthcare software company. I am also the owner of William Belle LLC, a software development company.

  That's it for now. Enjoy the blog, and take care. - Will
