## Introduction
There are many packages available to help you implement email functionality on your website or app.
I used the popular [nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/about/) library, and it paired really nicely with Next.js api
routes.

I will start by describing the contact form component. Next, I will discuss how I implemented the API endpoint to handle the
email requests. Finally, I will close by integrating the form with the endpoint.

To get the most out of this article, you should be familiar with Javascript, React, and Next.js. Let's get start by
reviewing the contact form component below.

```tsx
import useContactForm from '../hooks/useContactForm';

const ContactForm = () => {

  const {values, handleChange} = useContactForm();

  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault()
  }

  return (
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
          <label htmlFor='email'>Email</label>
          <input
              required
              id='email'
              value={values.email}
              onChange={handleChange}
              type='email'
          />

          <label htmlFor='subject'>Subject</label>
          <input
              required
              id='subject'
              value={values.subject}
              onChange={handleChange}
              type='text'
          />
          <label htmlFor='message'>Message</label>
          <textarea
              required
              value={values.message}
              onChange={handleChange}
              id='message'
              rows={8}
          />
        <button type='submit' value='Submit'>Send</button>
      </form>
  );
};

export default ContactForm;
```

## The form component
The form component is relatively straightforward, but let's break down what's going on here.

First, we import a custom hook called ```useContactForm``` (more on that later). Then, we destructure ```values``` and
```handleChange```. The ```values``` object represents the current state of the form inputs and has the following
properties and initial state.

```tsx
const values = {
    email: '',
    subject: '',
    message: '',
}
```

We also get a function called ```handleChange```, which will handle the form ```onChange``` events.

Working our way down in the function body, we have a ```handleSubmit``` function to handle the form ```onSubmit``` events.
Currently, the only thing it does is prevent the default form submission behavior. We will add more logic to handle the
form data later. For now, let's take a closer look at our ```useContactForm``` custom hook.

```tsx
import {useState} from 'react';

const useContactForm = () => {
  const [values, setValues] = useState({
    email: '',
    subject: '',
    message: '',
  });

  const handleChange = (e) => {
    setValues(prevState => {
      return {
        ...prevState,
        [e.target.id]: e.target.value,
      };
    });
  };

  return {values, handleChange};
};

export default useContactForm;
```

As mentioned earlier, the initial state of the values object contains properties defined by the id defined on the form
input, each with an initial value of an empty string.

The handleChange function updates the state by including all the elements from the current state using
[spread syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax).
Finally, we use ```e.target.id``` to update the target element's state dynamically. Check out the demo form below to update
the state using the ```useContactForm``` hook.

<DemoContactForm/>

There are certainly other ways to keep state for a form. The most common alternative that comes to mind is using
one ```useState``` hook for each form input. the useContact form allows us to accomplish the same goal with using way
less code.

Before moving on to the API, I created a function using [axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro), that we will use to
send requests to the API.

```tsx
import axios from 'axios';

const sendEmail = async (email, subject, message) => {
  return axios({
    method: 'post',
    url: '/api/send-mail',
    data: {
      email: email,
      subject: subject,
      message: message,
    },
  });
};

export default sendEmail;
```

We will come back to this when we wire up the form with the API.

## The API
I created the API endpoint with the built-in Next.js [Api Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction). I started with creating the following directory
in my Next.js project.

```url
/blog/pages/api
```

I named the endpoint ```send-mail.js```. So the url for the endpoint will be:

```url
http://localhost:3000/api/send-mail
```

Let's add some code to our endpoint.

```tsx
const nodemailer = require('nodemailer');

export default function handler(req, res) {

  const message = {
    from: req.body.email,
    to: process.env.GMAIL_EMAIL_ADDRESS,
    subject: req.body.subject,
    text: req.body.message,
    html: `<p>${req.body.message}</p>`,
  };

  let transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
    service: 'Gmail',
    auth: {
      user: process.env.GMAIL_EMAIL_ADDRESS,
      pass: process.env.GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD,
    },
  });

  if (req.method === 'POST') {
    transporter.sendMail(message, (err, info) => {

      if (err) {
        res.status(404).json({
            error: `Connection refused at ${err.address}`
        });
      } else {
        res.status(250).json({
            success: `Message delivered to ${info.accepted}`
        });
      }
    });
  }
}
```

Ok, there is a lot going on here. First included the ```nodemailer``` library. Next we have the function ```handler```, which
is the request handler, with the req and res parameters. Check out the [API Routes]() docs if you are not familiar
with the req and res objects.

Next, we create the nodemailer [message configuration](https://nodemailer.com/message/) object. I used Gmail as my
provider, but there a few caveats which are discussed here ([using Gmail](https://nodemailer.com/usage/using-gmail/)).
The excellent news is nodemailer supports many alternatives. The [nodemailer docs](https://nodemailer.com/about/) are
fantastic. I encourage you to review the docs if you are unfamiliar with the library.

We create the transporter object to send the mail data. The transporter function accepts the message data and an
optional callback. The callback gives us access to the ```error``` and ```info``` objects which I use to handle the
response.

That's it for the API. Now, let's wire up the contact form.

## Connecting the form to the api


Let's add the rest of the code to our ```handleSubmit``` function.

```tsx
import useContactForm from '../hooks/useContactForm';
import sendEmail from '../lib/sendEmail';
import {useState} from 'react';

const ContactForm = () => {

  const {values, handleChange} = useContactForm();
  const [responseMessage, setResponseMessage] = useState(
      {isSuccessful: false, message: ''});

  const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    try {
      const req = await sendEmail(values.email, values.subject, values.message);
      if (req.status === 250) {
        setResponseMessage(
            {isSuccessful: true, message: 'Thank you for your message.'});
      }
    } catch (e) {
      console.log(e);
      setResponseMessage({
        isSuccessful: false,
        message: 'Oops something went wrong. Please try again.',
      });
    }
  };

  return (
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
          <label htmlFor='email'>Email</label>
          <input
              required
              id='email'
              value={values.email}
              onChange={handleChange}
              type='email'
          />

          <label htmlFor='subject'>Subject</label>
          <input
              required
              id='subject'
              value={values.subject}
              onChange={handleChange}
              type='text'
          />
          <label htmlFor='message'>Message</label>
          <textarea
              required
              value={values.message}
              onChange={handleChange}
              id='message'
              rows={8}
          />
        <button type='submit' value='Submit'>Send</button>
      </form>
  );
};

export default ContactForm;
```

The handle submit function is converted to an
async function. We use the ```sendEmail``` function we created to await the response from the new API endpoint.
The response is saved as local state to ```responseMessage```.

## Conclusion
Now that we have the response set in local state, we can use that information to update the UI. Usually this includes
displaying alert to the user with the status of the message.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
